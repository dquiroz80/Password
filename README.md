## Description

This is the first time learning, using and understanding javascript.  I created a password generator that will generate a random passwod using uppercase letters and/or lowercase letter and/or special characters and/or numbers.  It is up to the user which ones they would like to use.  It will also make the user choose between 8 - 128 characters for the length of the password.
